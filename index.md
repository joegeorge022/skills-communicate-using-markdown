# This is a h1 header and this is the largest.
## This is a h2 header.
### This is a h3 header.
###### This is a h6 header which is the smallest.



The change I made to this file is that I added a markdown file named "index.md" and made the above text header's by putting # (upto 6 for h6) in-front of them. 
We learn to add headers(h1 to h6) and other text to .md files and how to format it.
